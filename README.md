**A Basic and Simple Instagram Clone App which is still under construction.**

## 🎊 Features
The app theme changes according to the theme of the device.!
* Try changing the theme of your phone and restart the app. The app theme will change automatically.

## ⚙️ Tech-Stack
The application is built entirely with Flutter. For the backend services, I have made use of Firebase.

## 🏃🏻 Getting Started
### Prerequisites:
* Get Flutter up and running. For this purpose visit - [Flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### Building from source:
* If you are using an IDE like [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), you may use suitable GUI/hotkeys. Here is how you can work things from the terminal.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jash-desai/insta-clone.git
    cd insta-clone
    flutter run
    ```
